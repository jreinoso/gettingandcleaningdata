# Getting & Cleaning Data Course Project

Hi everybody..   This is a repo for the Getting & Cleaning Data Course Project from Coursera.

###Files:

1. run_analysis.R:    R script for getting a tidy data set from the UCI HAR Dataset.
2. output.txt:        Tidy dataset.   I was loaded as .txt becuase Coursera platform doesn't allow .csv.  
                      In order to use it as csv file,  it should be renamed to output.csv.
